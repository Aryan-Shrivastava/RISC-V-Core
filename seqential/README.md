# Sequential Implementation
## Instructions from the TA
Use this folder to house the implementation of the sequential RISC V processor
- put all module files into a folder called `src` and have the main wrapper file as `main.v` 

## Our Code And Its Layout
The layout of our project folder is as follows
- `data_data.txt` contains the data in binary format to be loaded into our register file.
- `instructions.txt` contains the instructions in binary format being fetched by the instruction module.
- Rest are the verilog files with the main wrapper file named `main.v` and its testbench `main_testbench.v`.
